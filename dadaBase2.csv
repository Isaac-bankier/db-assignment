587,A Dad joke planted as a seed which took 17 years to flower,Not quite as tragic but it manifested into something which has haunted me at my job for yearsWhen I was a little kid learning about the world around me my dad was naturally the font of all knowledge for me He would answer all of little snippersmiths questions with his own unique insights and anecdotes teaching me of my surroundings with varying degrees of accuracyOne day In a picture book I encountered a photo of one of natures most bizarre creatures the mighty duck billed platypus Filled with curiosity of this bizarre creature and an Inability to read a young snippersmith asked his father what this creature was called To which his father repliedThats a QuackopotamousAs is a highly likely situation in day to day life the Platypus (or indeed the Quackopotamous) did not come into conversation for another 17 years Until of course the Platypus came into conversation around the lunch table at a now grown up snippersmiths full time place of workI have not been allowed to forget I thought the Platypus was called a Quackopotamous Indeed I am reminded on a daily basis by my colleagues by my nickname Quackopotamous Thanks DadEDIT 1 Holy Cow this took off!
