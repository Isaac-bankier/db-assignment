It was addressed, 'Dad'. 

With the worst premonition, I opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands:

""Dear, Dad. 

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. 

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. 

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. 

She's pregnant. 

Stacy said that we will be very happy. 

She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. 

We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. 

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. 

She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. 

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. 

I'm over at Jason's house.

52,Baby gender reveal at my family reunion,"My brother’s wife has been pregnant for five months and decided that they wanted to reveal the gender of the baby at our family reunion of about 40 people.

One night, after just finishing up a BBQ, my brother and his wife stand up and announce to the family that they are going to have a little baby girl.  Everyone starts cheering, naturally.

Once the cheers die down a little I shout out, “Do you have a name for the baby yet?”

My brother replies, “Yeah.  Liana Noelle.”

Everyone starts to “Ooohhh” and “Ahhhh” and proclaim how pretty of a name it is.

Then after a moment I shout, “How the hell are you supposed to spell Liana with no L?”

238,President Obama's 2016 Turkey-Pardon Dad Jokes: The Definitive List,"[from NPR-- this sub doesn't allow link posts]

The annual turkey pardon is a silly tradition, and President Obama knows it. On Wednesday, before pardoning turkeys named Tater and Tot, Obama summed up his feelings about this particular duty.

""It is my great privilege — well, it's my privilege — actually, let's just say it's my job to grant them clemency this afternoon,"" Obama said.

Not in attendance for the president's final turkey pardoning ceremony were first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama, who gamely laughed alongside their father last year. So instead, the president's nephews Austin and Aaron Robinson stood by for what Obama called his ""corny-copia of dad jokes about turkeys.""

And thus began a pun-fest for the ages. Here's a list of President Obama's groaners from this year's pardoning ceremony:

""Actually [Sasha and Malia] just couldn't take my jokes anymore. They were fed up.""

""What I haven't told them yet is we are going to do this every year from now on. No cameras, just us, every year. No way I'm cutting this habit cold turkey.""

""Tater is here in a backup role just in case Tot can't fulfill his duties. So he's sort of like the vice turkey. We're working on getting him a pair of aviator glasses.""

""I want to take a moment to recognize the brave turkeys who weren't so lucky. Who didn't get to ride the gravy train to freedom. Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren't chicken.""

[After touting positive economic indicators and the low uninsured rate] ""That's worth gobbling about.""

""We should also make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving. Of course, except the turkeys, because they're already stuffed.""

""When somebody at your table tells you that you've been hogging all of the side dishes, you can't have any more, I hope that you respond with a creed that sums up the spirit of a hungry people: 'Yes, we cran.' ""

""Look, I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the last time I'm doing this, so we're not leaving any room for leftovers.""

""And now from the Rose Garden, Tater and Tot will go to their new home at Virginia Tech, which is admittedly a bit hokey."" (The Hokies are the Virginia Tech mascot.)

""And so let's get on with the pardoning. Because it's Wednesday afternoon and everyone knows that Thanksgiving traffic can put people in a foul mood.""

Next was Dimitri because it's not too common and sounds artsy. Girlfriend was not much of a fan, but agreed it would sound good with our last name.

Last was Nicholas Levar for a son's name. Named after Santa Claus and Star Trek's Geordi La Forge. I love Christmas and my girlfriend loves Star Trek. Girlfriend shot it down.

At this point I said, ""But the nicknames are good! Penny, Dime, and Nick L. We would have 16 cents to our name! It makes cents to me!""

548,My dad at my Grandmother's Funeral,"My grandmother was cremated and we were having a service to pay our respects. I was scared and didn't want to go up to the altar alone so my dad went with me.

We stood there, side by side, and stared in reverent silence at the small simple wooden box which was holding my grandmother's ashes. After a minute or so passed my father bowed slightly, leaning in with what I assumed would be words of wisdom and said, ""your grandmother was a lot smaller than I remember.""

I had to fight just not to bust out laughing in a room full of mourners.

One day In a picture book, I encountered a photo of one of natures most bizarre creatures, the mighty duck billed platypus. Filled with curiosity of this bizarre creature and an Inability to read a young snippersmith asked his father what this creature was called, To which his father replied,

That's a Quackopotamous.....

As is a highly likely situation in day to day life the Platypus (or indeed the Quackopotamous), did not come into conversation for another 17 years, Until of course the Platypus came into conversation around the lunch table at a now grown up snippersmith's full time place of work.


I have not been allowed to forget I thought the Platypus was called a Quackopotamous, Indeed I am reminded on a daily basis by my colleagues, by my nickname Quackopotamous .

After I had popped the question, there was silence, Wanya turns over to my girlfriend, and says, ""You can say, he's On Bended Knee."" I heard my girlfriend silently groan under her breath, before she said YES!

I'm notorious for puns in our relationship, so after he came through with that punchline, she knew that they were in on it too. What an honorable night for a dadjoke!

After dessert we're all sitting around and the children present are being rowdy. My roomate's brother calls them all over to our table and insists on showing them how to make a duck call. He begins ripping apart an empty soda can and wrapping it up in a very complicated fashion with a napkin and a plastic fork. He meticulously takes the top off, makes strips of metal, and winds them into this plastic fork. He carries on like this for about five minutes, the children utterly transfixed, sit watching until his creation is finally ""complete"". He then holds it up to his mouth, inhales, and shouts: ""HERE DUCKY DUCKY DUCKY!!!""",1386495032.0,1872,PhilboBaggins93,ff48156118cd89137ddc6041f9ace6ec821725c1cc41c30d4a7357e099710d1b53ca799a9cb78fcf5dbb472b38a196d411dbf9505197cf17c681fbfcda02642b
